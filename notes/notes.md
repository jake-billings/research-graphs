From dissertation pg 32:

A much more accessible question is to search for extremal graphs for ex(40, {C3, C4, C6}). Even though a polarity graph
of a generalized quadrangle of order 3 does not exist, it still may be informative to find the extremal graphs on 40
vertices. If a polarity graph did exist it would have 75 edges. So an open question is whether or not there are graphs
on 40 vertices, with no 3, 4 or 6-cycles that have 75 edges or more.
